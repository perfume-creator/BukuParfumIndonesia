THE MECHANICS OF SMELL
11
For the brain, the sense of smell is an open window to the
world: when we breathe in an aroma through our nose,
information travels up to our neurons. But what do they do
with it? And what makes a scent pleasant or unpleasant to us?
How does a smell bring back a memory, sometimes in a Very
powerful and immediate way? In short, how does our sense of
smell work? Here, we examine thejourney of an odour, from
detection to perception.
When you put your nose into a bouquet of flowers it only takes
a brief moment for the information contained in the perfume to
reach your brain and trigger reactions as diverse as
That smells
"That reminds me of something nice
or
don't like it"
The scent of a flower is made up of several hundred different
odour molecules which are light and volatile. Produced by the
plant; these molecules are released into the air and arrive at our
nostrils. From that moment, the brain's detection and
recognition of them happens in a series of
coordinated
by a
specific brain system Which is present in all mammals: the
olfactory system: So, for each and every one of Us, it all begins
in our nose and ends deep inside our brain:
