THE HISTORY OF PERFUMERY

"Perfumes serve the purpose of the most superfluous of all
forms of luxury, for pearls and jewels do nevertheless pass to
the wearer's heir, and clothes last for some time, but
unguents lose their scent at once, and die in the very hour
when they are used" (Pliny the Elder, Natural History).
Denounced and ridiculed for as long as satire has existed, our
use of perfume is at once sacred and frivolous, and its power
has been applied in fields as diverse as religion, medicine, and
the art of seduction.

In 1784, Marie Antoinette moved

Versailles, which opened directly

to her children: The apartment
had
a
bedroom, a library and a
bathroom, which was entirely
refurbished in 1788 with extre-
mely fine decorations: swans
drinking from a basin, dolphins,
shells and rushes. In April, the
floor was laid with black and
white marble tiles, and in July
the pipework was installed; hot
and cold water poured into the
bathtub from two swans necks
