While deconstructing the olfactory makeup
of pepper (Piper nigrum), Wilhelm Rudolph
Fittig and W. H. Mielck made piperonal for the
first time in 1869. Its complete structure was
revealed in 1871 by Rudolph Fittig as well as Ira
Remsen: The aroma of this compound is very
far removed from pepper and is more akin
to the delicate, powdery scent of heliotrope
flowers. In 1876, chemists Ferdinand Tiemann

CHAPTER III
MUGUETS
Dainty bells
The natural odour of muguet, also known
as Iily of the valley, contains a mix of indole
citronellol, nerol, cinnamyl alcohol, benzyl
alcohol, benzyl benzoate, farnesol, cis-3 -
hexenol, cis-3-hexenyl acetate, dihydrofarnesal
and phenyl acetaldehyde oxime_
But it is a
defiant flower and its delicate scent is impossible
to extract, because it only produces very little
of the substances mentioned. Moreover; these
fragile substances are destroyed by even the
most gentle extraction methods. Muguet's few
characteristic molecules cannot even be used
in a
synthetic form in perfumery; because they
break down too quickly in a composition. So
the only way to reproduce the flower is by using
other artificial molecules with similar aromas.
