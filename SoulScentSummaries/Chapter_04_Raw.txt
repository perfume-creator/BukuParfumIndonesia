THE PERFUMER
S PROFESS ION
79
Contrary to popular belief, perfumers are not born, they are
made. Most societies do not teach children to develop their
olfactory memory, or encourage any particular curiosity in
the world of aromas Embarking on a career in perfumery
means there is a lot of
catching-up to do. The ability to find
words for the smells our noses detect, to know how to group
them and even to
up on nuances between them can only
be gained through longand rigorous training:
The perfumer's job is to produce an olfactory translation f an

do so by using the various raw materials available to
them and skilfully marry them together; with balance and
structure The idea may spring spontaneously from the
perfumer's imagination or be drawn from a brief, a specific
request,
or even a personal challenge.
A
perfumer needs a
range of different qualities: curiosity, orderliness, patience,
attentiveness, an excellent understanding of raw ingredients as
well as formulation, and also a lot of humility. Some of these
qualities cannot be learned, but don't think that this profession
is innate: olfaction and formulation are taught; This is how We
come to realise that perfumery is not a mathematical science
and that there are many surprises hidden along the road to
creation.
