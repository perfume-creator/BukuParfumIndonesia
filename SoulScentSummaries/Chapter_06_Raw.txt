PRODUCTION

Whether it'sa few litres or several thousand, a perfume is
always produced according to the same method, The
concentrate, in other words the blend of fragrant ingredients
which make up the formula, is made first. Next, this
concentrate is diluted in alcohol to create the perfume:
Lastly, the perfume is bottled and packed for delivery to
different sales outlets. The route is very well mapped.
Brands have a varying degree of involvement in the production
of their perfumes A few undertake every step themselves:
these are either small independent brands with volumes Iow
enough to be made in an
'artisanal' way, or, conversely, big
brands which possess the infrastructure and resources
necessary to handle production in its entirety and on an
industrial scale. This defining feature allows these brands to
choose and manage their supply of raw materials. However,
contract manufacturers often ensure they are able to
accomodate an original formula by adapting their catalogue
where necessary:
In the vast majority of cases, brands pay a composition house
to make a certain quantity
measured in kilograms
of
concentrate, produced in imposing factories where white coats
and safety boots are customary: These brands then dilute
the concentrate in alcohol and package the resulting perfume,
either in house or using other subcontractors
