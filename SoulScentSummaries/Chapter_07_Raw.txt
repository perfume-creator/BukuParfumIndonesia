DISTRIBUTION
133
The biggest challenge in a perfume's journey begins once it has
been produced: distribution.
Will it be sold in-store or online? Directly, or through a network
of resellers? Distribution has to be discussed at a very early
stage of the concept design process, even before the formula
is finalised. Decisions have to be made about choosing the
distribution network as Well as the country, or at least the
market area, where it will be sold. The distribution strategy has
to reflect the brand's universe, resources, and ambitions.
Over the last 20 years, the tendency has been to distinguish
between mainstream perfumery and niche perfumery. But the
lines between these two segments have blurred, to the extent
that their distribution channels now overlap:
In 2018, the worldwide perfumery market was worth $42
billion. That figure could well rise to S53 billion in 2025. This
highly favourable outlook is encouraging the emergence of new
players and making relationships between brands and
distributors even more competitive. At a time when consumers
are increasingly turning to online purchases, the distribution
battle is entering a new era:
