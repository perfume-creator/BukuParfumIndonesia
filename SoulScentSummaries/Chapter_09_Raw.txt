INDEPENDENT PERFUMERY
163
First emerging in the 1960s and 70s, the independent
perfumery sector has been undergoing continuous growth
since the 2000s, ata rate of approximately 15 per cent each
year: More and more people have been choosing to strike
out on an independent path, from recent perfumery
graduates to composition house stars, perfume aficionados
to businesswomen and businessmen. But what does
creating a brand represent and how is it done?
Today, couturiers and jewellers are not the only ones to sell
perfume via licences with large corporates. Dozens of new
brands are launched each
including independent brands.
Although some are relatively successful or are bought by larger
entities, many of them quickly sink out of sight, as getting noticed
by consumers in such a crowded market is remarkably difficult.
Independent perfumery comprises brands that are not
connected to any business (luxury, cosmetics, or anything else)
and have limited distribution and, usually, far greater creative
freedom than other brands. Generally speaking; they offer a
personal vision of perfume, focussed on the creative process
and less influenced by market trends. However; the economic
reality of an independent brand is very different from that of
selective perfumery:

There are many reasons for setting out
on this particular adventure, such as:
Developing a brand, an aesthetic vision,
or to live out your passion;
To create business activity in a sector undergoing
strong growth and propose an original concept;
To update or modernise a brand so as to attract
the attention of large corporates in order to sell it.
These goals are not mutually incompatible and are
often combined to boost the chance of creating a
viable brand: The goal is, after all, to sell. Especially

Communication generally comes into play following the

Investing in the web
Although designing a website
requires a substantial amount of
money, it has become an essen-
tial showcase for anyone wanting
to promote their products. An
independent brand can hardly
do without one. The budget for
the design of a website can vary
depending on what you opt for:
A simple website (without an
online storel: around $1,650;
A website with an online store:
around $5,500 (possibly much
more
depending on the level of
customisation).
Another vital online tool comes
in the form of social media
platforms like Facebook and
Instagram. Brands often build
their reputation through these
platforms, by interacting with
customers and perfume lovers
who chat, ask questions, and stay
up to date with the latest news:
