LIFE OF
A
PERFUME
183
There is no denying that, from start to finish, a perfume has a
turbulent life. Its existence always begins with a plant before
chemistry steps in to make it grow, guided by the perfumer's
imagination: It then flourishes by way of advertisements or
word of mouth: But once it has settled down ina perfume
store, no one knows if it will stay there six months or
100 years.
Natural resources are depleting; regulations are multiplying; and
research and development (R&D) have become the crux of
perfumery: In a saturated and highly competitive market, the life
of the most democratic and profitable of luxury accessories is
far from tranquil. Unlike diamonds, formulas do not tend to be
forever. Once a fragrance has disappeared from the market,
perfume lovers make every effort to safeguard the olfactory
heritage for fear of it being forgotten: In the bottle, it's another
story: behind the same name, a perfume regularly has to
undergo a makeover in order to conform to applicable
regulations.

Then there is the fact that flowers
now grow in fungicide- andpesticide-
ridden soil, which undoubtedly alters
their scent; And that certain molecules
which featured in the original formula
have since been banned by ever stricter
European cosmetic directives. Not to
mention the yearly modifications the
IFRA, the self-regulatory representative
body ofthe fragrance industry makes to
its regulations, threatening to suppress
or limit the use of certain molecules
in perfumery for ecological and
precautionary reasons These decisions
lead to the continuous reformulation of
many fragrances on the market:
SUBSTANCES UNDER FIRE
As early as 2002, Brussels obliged
perfume producers to include a list of
26 potentially allergenic substances on
their packaging: In 2012, the European
Scientific Committee on Consumer
Safety (SCCS) published a report on
substances deemed to be dangerous
